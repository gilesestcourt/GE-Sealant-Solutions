  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Giles Estcourt, a dedicated mastic and silicone sealant specialist based on the South Coast.
    I take pride in clean, precise application and never rush jobs or cut corners. Whether I’m working on new builds, bathrooms, or commercial units, I deliver reliable, long-lasting finishes that elevate the space.
    You’ll deal directly with me every step of the way — no teams, no subcontracting, just high-quality workmanship and clear communication.
